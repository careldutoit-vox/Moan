 Use a wildcard mapping for aspnet_isapi.dll This tells IIS 6 to process all requests using ASP.NET, so routing is always invoked, and there’s no problem. It’s dead easy to set up: open IIS manager, right-click your app, go to Properties, then Home Directory tab, then click Configuration. Under Wildcard application maps, click Insert (not Add, which is confusingly just above), then enter
 C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v2.0.50727\aspnet_isapi.dll for “Executable”, and uncheck Verify that file exists.

  else you'll be doing ASP.Net from IIS all day and not get your MVC URL's to work
 but you do not need that for dealersites do you?
